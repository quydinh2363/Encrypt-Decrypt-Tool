# Welcome to my Repository - Encryption/Decryption Tool project

# Encryption/Decryption Tool

This project is written by Python, provides a simple GUI tool for encrypting and decrypting files using RSA and AES algorithms. The tool generates a random password, encrypts it with RSA, and uses the password to symmetrically encrypt the file with AES.

## Features

- Generate RSA key pair (private and public keys)
- Encrypt files using AES algorithm
- Decrypt files using AES algorithm
- Secure password generation and encryption
- User-friendly GUI

## You will find in this repo:

* enc_app.py is a code file.
* You can find the .exe file in the dist folder.

## Installation:

- **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/quydinh2363/Encrypt-Decrypt-Tool.git
   cd encryption-decryption-tool
   
- You can go to the dist folder and run the .exe file.
- Encrypt a File:
